Puts ALL skills alphabetically including custom skills. (In example, I have some skills removed utilizing Mana's Mini Module found @ https://gitlab.com/mkahvi/fvtt-micro-modules/-/tree/master/pf1-hidden-skills)

Known issues:
Skills with add button are placed at bottom otherwise they would be at the top.
Subskills are placed at the top.
